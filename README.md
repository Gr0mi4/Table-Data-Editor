Hello! 

This project is a simple Table Data Editor, made to work with JSON and CSV Data. Examples of the data you can find on the main page
index.html. The main function is showing data imported as a string in the table on the main page. User can change it in various ways
- add rows
- remove rows
- invert rows
- change chosen data
- unload data back to the way to the JSON and CSV formats.

The project was written on vanilla JS with the use of the Bootstrap 4(just a little bit).
